## Quick Start
### 1. Download
Download the latest version of `PortraitReplacer.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Hammuu1112/portrait_replacer/releases/latest). After downloading, extract the files and run `PortraitReplacer.exe`.

<br/>

### 2. Select Options and Start
On the first screen, you can choose language and the BDO portrait folder.

Upon first launch, the language of your PC and the default BDO portrait folder will be automatically selected, but if the folder is empty, you will need to select it manually.

Once all options are selected, click the `Start` button at the bottom right.

> The default BDO portrait folder is `Documents\Black Desert\FaceTexture`.

<br/>

### 3. Synchronize Portrait Order (Optional)
Once the loading is complete, you can long-press a portrait and drag it to match the in-game portrait order.

### 5. Save
Click the `Save` button at the bottom left to save the changes.

> Portrait Replacer does not have a built-in backup feature for existing portraits, so it’s recommended to back up the `FaceTexture` folder before starting.
